# Load Data into One Lake

Microsoft Fabric offers Data Factory Component to load data from your sources into onelake. This could range from on-premise data sources (CRM systems/databases/ERP systems etc) , external data suppliers and even your own local machine. You could also use the [one lake file explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/onelake/onelake-file-explorer) or the [lake house object explorer](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/navigate-lakehouse-explorer) in  fabric UI to upload files from your local machine to one lake directly. </br>

In many scenarios you might want to upload a local file and combine this with data coming in from other systems. These scnearios are enabled for you using Fabric.
